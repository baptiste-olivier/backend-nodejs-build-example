This project aims to compare different build methods

## Installation & running builds

`npm install`

## Different builds

- Raw transcription to javascript : `npm run build`
- Transcription + uglify-folder : `npm run build2`
- Packaging through pgk : `npm run build3`
- Packaging through pgk + compression : `npm run build4`

Once a build is run, try to find the secret 'not-so-secret'
